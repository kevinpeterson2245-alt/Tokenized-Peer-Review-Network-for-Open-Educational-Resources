# 📚 Tokenized Peer-Review Network for Open Educational Resources

Welcome to a revolutionary platform that enhances the quality and accessibility of open educational resources (OER) using blockchain technology! This Web3 project addresses the real-world problem of inconsistent quality in free educational content, lack of incentives for creators and reviewers, and limited global access to premium learning opportunities. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, contributors can earn tokenized credits through peer-reviewed submissions, which are redeemable for real-world courses from partnered institutions worldwide.

## ✨ Features

🔍 Submit and peer-review educational resources like articles, videos, courses, or datasets  
🏆 Earn redeemable credits for quality contributions and honest reviews  
📈 Reputation system to build trust among users  
🌍 Global redemption network for courses from universities and online platforms  
🔒 Immutable records of reviews and contributions for transparency  
🚀 Tokenized incentives to encourage ongoing participation  
✅ Automated dispute resolution for contested reviews  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Contributors**  
- Upload your OER (e.g., via IPFS hash) and submit it for review.  
- Peers review your work based on criteria like accuracy, originality, and usefulness.  
- If approved, earn credits proportional to the resource's impact (measured by views, ratings, etc.).  

**For Reviewers**  
- Stake credits to participate in reviews (to prevent spam).  
- Submit detailed feedback and ratings.  
- Earn rewards if your review aligns with the community consensus.  

**For Learners**  
- Browse verified OER for free.  
- Redeem accumulated credits for premium courses from partners (integrated via oracles).  

**Token Mechanics**  
- The platform uses a native token (e.g., EDU-Token) for rewards, staking, and governance.  
- Credits are non-transferable but redeemable, ensuring they stay tied to educational value.  

This system solves the fragmentation in OER by creating a decentralized, incentivized ecosystem that mirrors academic peer-review but makes it accessible and rewarding for everyone.

## 🔗 Smart Contracts Overview

The project is built with 8 Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, each handling specific aspects for modularity and security. Here's a high-level breakdown:

1. **ResourceRegistry.clar**  
   Registers new OER submissions with metadata (title, description, IPFS hash, creator address). Ensures uniqueness and timestamps entries immutably.

2. **ReviewSubmission.clar**  
   Allows qualified users to submit reviews, including scores and comments. Enforces review periods and prevents self-reviews.

3. **TokenMinting.clar**  
   Manages the EDU-Token (fungible token standard in Clarity). Handles minting rewards for approved contributions and reviews.

4. **StakingMechanism.clar**  
   Requires reviewers to stake tokens before participating, slashing stakes for malicious behavior to maintain integrity.

5. **ReputationTracker.clar**  
   Tracks user reputations based on contribution quality, review accuracy, and community feedback. Influences voting weight and reward multipliers.

6. **GovernanceDAO.clar**  
   Enables token holders to vote on platform updates, like review criteria or partnership additions, using a simple DAO model.

7. **RedemptionOracle.clar**  
   Integrates with external oracles to verify and process credit redemptions for real-world courses, ensuring off-chain fulfillment.

8. **DisputeResolution.clar**  
   Handles challenges to reviews or approvals, allowing community votes to resolve conflicts and adjust rewards accordingly.

These contracts interact seamlessly (e.g., ResourceRegistry calls ReviewSubmission upon submission), providing a robust, scalable solution. Deploy them on Stacks for Bitcoin-secured transactions!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install the Stacks wallet and Clarity dev tools.  
2. Deploy the contracts in order (starting with TokenMinting for dependencies).  
3. Build a frontend (e.g., with React) to interact via Hiro Wallet.  
4. Test on the Stacks testnet—submit a sample OER and review it!
